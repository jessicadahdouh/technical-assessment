- Make sure you have python3.10 downloaded on your pc
- Clone the repository from github
- Create a virtual environment using the following commands:
	pip install --upgrade pip
	pip install virtualenv
	python -m venv venv
- Activate the venv through:
 	python venv\Scripts\activate
- Install the requirements:
	pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run the app through:
	uvicorn app:app
- Go to the postman collection and start testing.

- In postman set the FastApi url (http://127.0.0.1:8000) as baseUrl environment variable.

- When testing start as follows:
	- create an admin user to begin with in order to be able to create a new user and manipulate it
	- endpoints order is as follows:
		- healthcheck
		- /user/create_admin_user (take the access_token and put in it in the authorization headers of the next request)
		- /user/create_user (make sure the token is of type "Bearer")
		- /auth/login (to generate token and login)
		The following can be interchangable:
		- /user/get_user_info
		- /user/edit_user
		- /user/delete_user (you should login again in order to be able to delete your user - inorder for the token to refresh)
